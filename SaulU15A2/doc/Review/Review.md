## User feedback - Alternative Design

| Name | Rating | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Armandas B | 6 | Basic colour scheme and good selection of fonts. Content well placed on the page and not cluttered. |
| Viktor | 4 | High contrast between dark grey and blue for the buttons that make them difficult to use, and lost of space between content that does not need it. |

## User feedback - Main Design

| Name | Rating | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Armandas B | 5 | Colour scheme becomes even simpler, with a lack of defining or memorable features of the page. A user probably wouldn't remember it well with such a simplistic look. |
| Viktor | 8 | Shape and colour of the website is clean. The greys look good together and aren't distracting. |

## Review of Design successes and failures

Armandas' comment on the simplicity of both designs is feedback I find  to be true and useful. I have kept this simplicity through to the final website and refrained from implementing and complex features. I did however grow concerned over the over abstraction of the website. I decided to add some different ways to display content, such as tabs and carosels as well as change the layout on some key pages, such as the application page. I felt this could have been developed further, and that contrast of colours and a more dynamic and interesting design layout could have improved the page significantly.

Functionally, it means all  of the physical requirements of the user.
